r"""Build-time (static) unit-consistency check for the Hamilton DAG.

The runtime check (``declare_units`` → ``check_units``) only fires when a node
executes. `check_dag_units` adds the complementary guarantee at *build*
time: every internal edge whose producer and consumer both declare a unit is
verified for consistency, so a mismatch surfaces as soon as the driver is built
rather than part way through a run.

Declarations are read from each node's public function signature via
`satterc.units.units_from_signature` — the same single source the runtime
check uses. Hamilton unifies nodes by name, so a node name that is both
*produced* with a declared unit (a ``TypedDict`` field or bare ``Annotated``
return) and *consumed* with a declared unit (an ``Annotated`` parameter) is a
genuine edge in the built graph; no edge walking is required.

**Limitation.** Edges routed through resample/node modules, or fed by external
files, have no statically declared producer unit (resample preserves the source
``units`` attribute at runtime; node modules are generated; file inputs are
validated against the file's own ``units``). Those edges are not checked here and
fall back to the runtime check.

The complementary `check_input_units` performs the *runtime* leg of that
fallback for **external file inputs**: it validates the ``units`` attribute of the
actually-loaded input ``DataArray``\\ s against the units declared by the nodes that
consume them. This is the only data-dependent part of unit validation (every
internal edge's unit is fixed by declarations/stamping), so it can run without
executing any node — the basis of ``satterc run --dry-run``. Inputs routed through
a unit-preserving ``resample`` node before reaching a declaring consumer are covered
via backward propagation; inputs routed through a ``[[node]]`` module are *not*,
since a node can transform units arbitrarily and would have to actually run.
